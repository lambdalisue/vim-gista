features:

- List entries
  - List gists of a lookup
  - List commits of a gist

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENT					*vim-gista-requirement*

One of the following is required for communicating with Gist API.

- Vim compiled with |+python| (Recommended)
- cURL (http://curl.haxx.se)
- wget (https://www.gnu.org/software/wget)

To enable fast feching in |:Gista-list|, you need a Vim compiled with
|+python| or |+python3|.
Note that Vim compiled with |+python3| without cURL or wget is not supported for
now. The recommended environment is a Vim compiled with |+python| or a Vim
compiled with |+python3| with cURL or wget.


==============================================================================
INSTALL						*vim-gista-install*

Use any Vim plugin manager such as dein.vim (Shougo/dein.vim) or
vim-plug (junegunn/vim-plug) to install this plugin like:
>
	" vim-plug
	Plug 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'

	" dein.vim
	call dein#add('lambdalisue/vim-gista')
	" dein.vim (lazy)
	call dein#add('lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
	  \ 'on_cmd': 'Gista',
	  \})
<
Or install the repository into your |runtimepath| manually.


==============================================================================
USAGE						*vim-gista-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORIZATION					*vim-gista-authorization*

Note that a explicit authorization is not required when user specify user's
GitHub account to |g:gista#client#default_username|. Temporal authorization
will use that username to login GitHub API whenever users execute command (See
|vim-gista-temporal-authorization|).

If you would like to expressly login into your GitHub account, call
|:Gista-login| like:
>
	:Gista login YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME
<
It requires your GitHub password to create a personal access token for the
first time. Once the personal access token is created, you won't need to
re-input your GitHub password until you permanently logout from GitHub API
(See |:Gista-logout|).
It automatically obtain your GitHub username if you defined that in your
.gitconfig with a command below:
>
	$ git config github.user YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME
<
If you prefer to directly specify your GitHub username, use
|g:gista#client#default_username| or if you would like to use vim-gista as an
anonymouse mode in default, disable resolving GitHub username by specifing 0
to |g:gista#client#use_git_config_github_username|.

If you would like to login your GitHub Enterprise API, use
|gista#client#register()| function to register your API like:
>
	call gista#client#register('GHE', 'https://your.ghe.api.url')
<
And specify 'GHE' to '--apiname' option like:
>
	:Gista login --apiname=GHE YOUR_USER_NAME
<
If you would like to specify a default apiname, use
|g:gista#client#default_apiname|. The apiname is also used in temporal
authorization explained below (|vim-gista-temporal-authorization|).

Note that you need to call |gista#client#register()| everytime when you want to
use your GHE accout so use your |vimrc| file to call the command.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TEMPORAL AUTHORIZATION			*vim-gista-temporal-authorization*

All commands except |:Gista-login| and |:Gista-logout| support a temporal
authorization. For example, if you would like to open a private gist of your
second account, use --username option to temporary login to your second
account like:
>
	:Gista --username=YOUR_SECOND_ACCOUNT open GISTID
<
If you would like to post a current content to your GHE, use '--apiname' to
temporary login to your second API like:
>
	:Gista --apiname=GHE --username=YOUR_GHE_ACCOUNT post
<
If you would like to post a gist as an anonymous user, use '--anonymous' to
temporary logout from your account like:
>
	:Gista --anonymous post
<
Note that --apiname, --username, and --anonymous options requires to be
specify to |:Gista| command, namely before {command}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIST					*vim-gista-list*

Call |:Gista-list| to list your personal gists like:
>
	:Gista list
<
It automatically fetch gists of your account or public gists when you have
not login. If you would like to list starred gists, use 'starred' like:
>
	:Gista list starred
<
If you would like to list a public gists or gists of a particular user, use
'public' or a username like
>
	:Gista list public
	:Gista list USERNAME
<
See |:Gista-list| for detail.

If you would like to see commits of an existing gist, call |:Gista-commits|
like:
>
	:Gista commits {GISTID}
<
See |:Gista-commits| for detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN					*vim-gista-open*

Call |:Gista-open| to open a gist like:
>
	:Gista open GISTID
<
If you would like to see a JSON content of a gist, use |:Gista-json| instead
like:
>
	:Gista json GISTID
<
If you would like to open a remote content of the gist, use |:Gista-browse|
like:
>
	:Gista browse GISTID
<
See |:Gista-open|, |:Gista-json|, or |:Gista-browse| for detail.

vim-gista define |BufReadCmd| for a filename which start from 'gista://', mean
that you can use a |gf| mapping to open a filename like the following (hit gf
on the filenames below).
>
	gista://GitHub/16414ff40d5338d93dd3/test.vim 
	gista://GitHub/16414ff40d5338d93dd3.json
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST					*vim-gista-post*

Call |:Gista-post| to post a content of the current buffer to a new gist like:
>
	:Gista post
<
If you would like to post a content of the current buffer to an existing gist,
use |:Gista-patch| like:
>
	:Gista patch GISTID
<
See |:Gista-post| or |:Gista-patch| for detail.

:Gista login [-h/--help] [-n/--apiname={APINAME}] {username}

	Login into API of {APINAME} with {username}. If {APINAME} is omited,
	a current {APINAME} or |g:gista#client#default_apiname| is used.
	If {username} is omited, |g:gista#client#default_username| is used or
	the username will be obtained from 'git config github.user' when
	|g:gista#client#use_git_config_github_username| is 1.
	All posterior commands use an user account authorized with this
	command.
	See |vim-gista-authorization| if you would like to use your GitHub
	Enterprise API.
	See |vim-gista-temporal-authorization| if you would like to temporary
	login into API.

	Open a {filename} of {gistid}. In an opened buffer, users can post
	content changes with |:write| command if the current user and the
	owner of the gist is equal. Otherwise the buffer is opened as
	un-|modifiable| buffer.

						*vim-gista-Gista-json*

            [{gistid}]

	Open a JSON content of {gistid}. An opened buffer is opened as
	un-|modifiable| buffer.
	Note that the content of the buffer is different when |g:gista#debug|
	is 1 to see a debug information.

						*vim-gista-Gista-list*
						*:Gista-list*

>
	:Gista list
	" => Request gists only when a corresponding cahce does not exist
	:Gista list --no-cache
	" => Request created/updated gists since the last access
	:Gista list --no-cache --since=SINCE
	" => Request created/updated gists since {SINCE}
	:Gista list --no-cache --no-since
	" => Request entire gists
	:Gista! list
	" => Request entire gists (same as --no-cache --no-since)
<
	Note that --since option is not supported for 'public' gists, naemly
	it always request entire gists (up to 3000 gists) of 'public' when
	--no-cache option is specified.

	When the Vim was compiled with |+python| and/or |+python3|, an extra
	option, --[no-]python, becomes available. The option stands for
	enabling a Python fetcher which request pages of gists in multi-thread
	technology to drastically improve the response. If you would like to
	use a default fetcher, use --no-python option.

FAQ						*vim-gista-faq*

Q.
HTTP 502 Bad Gateway is shown in Windows

A.
Check if you are using a correct curl by
>
	$ packman -Sl | grep curl
	mingw32 mingw-w64-i686-curl 7.46.0-2
	mingw64 mingw-w64-x86_64-curl 7.46.0-2 [installed]
	msys curl 7.46.0-1 [installed]
	msys libcurl 7.46.0-1 [installed]
	msys libcurl-devel 7.46.0-1
	msys curl is not supported. You need to install mingw64-curl
<
If both of mingw-w64-i686-curl and mingw-w64-x86_64-curl are not [installed],
vim-gista may not work correctly. So to enable vim-gista, install a correct
curl like:
>
	$ packman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-curl
<
Note that you may need to add "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin" to PATH after that.


Q.
I would like to assign a personal access token directly without login

A.
Create a token vimson in 'token/{APINAME}' at |g:gista#client#cache_dir| (for
example, '~/.cache/vim-gista/token/GitHub') with the following content:
>
	{ 'username': 'your personal access token' }
<
Remember that you have to enable 'gist' access to the access token.
