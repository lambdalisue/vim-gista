![vim-gista interface (screencast)](./doc/screencast-interface.gif)

Version: 0.1.18
Support: Vim 7.3 and above (Let me know if there are issues)

*vim-gista* is a plugin for manipulating [Gists](https://gist.github.com/).
It provide the following features:

1. Listing gists
  - Authenticated user's gist entries
  - Authenticated user's starred gist entries
  - Gist entries of a particular user
  - Gist entries in Gist web
  - Listing gist entries in Unite (require '[Shougo/unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)')
2. Opening gists
  - Open files of an authenticated user in modifiable buffers
  - Open files of a particular user in nomodifiable buffers
  - Open files of a gist with a browser (require '[tyru/open-browser.vim](https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim)')
3. Posting gists
  - Create a new gist from a current buffer
  - Create a new gist from all opened+listed+visible buffers
4. Editing gists
  - A file content of a gist
  - A description of a gist
  - Rename a file of a gist
  - Remove a file of a gist
5. Deleting gists
6. Giving/taking a star to a gist
7. Forking a gist

The original concepts and strategies are taken from '[mattn/gist.vim](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim)'; however the most of these are aggressively modified to establish vim-gista new implementations.



How to install
==============================================================================
First of all, vim-gista use '[cURL](http://curl.haxx.se)' or '[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget)' to communicate with Gist API thus make sure that one of those commands is available in your system.

The [repository](https://github.com/lambdalisue/vim-gista) follow a standard vim plugin's directory structure thus you can use [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) or [neobundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) to install vim-gista like:

```vim
" Vundle.vim
Plugin 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'

" neobundle.vim
NeoBundle 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'

" neobundle.vim (Lazy)
NeoBundleLazy 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
    \ 'autoload': {
    \    'commands': ['Gista'],
    \    'mappings': '<Plug>(gista-',
    \    'unite_sources': 'gista',
    \}}
```

Additionally, vim-gista require '[Shougo/unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)' and '[tyru/open-browser.vim](https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim)' to enable all features thus make sure that these plugins are loaded before the plugins like:

```vim
" Vundle.vim
Plugin 'Shougo/unite.vim'
Plugin 'tyru/open-browser.vim'
Plugin 'lambdalisue/vim-gista'

" neobundle.vim
NeoBundle 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
    \ 'depends': [
    \    'Shougo/unite.vim',
    \    'tyru/open-browser.vim',
    \]}

" neobundle.vim (Lazy)
NeoBundleLazy 'lambdalisue/vim-gista', {
    \ 'depends': [
    \    'Shougo/unite.vim',
    \    'tyru/open-browser.vim',
    \ ],
    \ 'autoload': {
    \    'commands': ['Gista'],
    \    'mappings': '<Plug>(gista-',
    \    'unite_sources': 'gista',
    \}}
```

If you are not using any vim plugin manager, you can copy the repository to your $VIM directory to enable the plugin but I really recommend you to try one of those vim plugin managers.

Once you installed vim-gista, specify your GitHub username to g:gista#github_user| variable like the code below. |vim-gista use that username in API authentication step.

```vim
let g:gista#github_user = 'your GitHub user name'
```

If nothing is specified to g:gista#github_user or g:github_user, vim-gista try to get your username from git profile ('github.user') thus you can specify your username in git command like:

```sh
$ git config --global github.user <your GitHub user name>
```

How to use
==============================================================================


Authentication
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![vim-gista authentication (screencast)](./doc/screencast-authentication.gif)

If you execute any vim-gista commands, functions, or mappings, vim-gista ask you to fill your GitHub password (or your GitHub username if you have not specified it yet) at first time.
The filled password will be used to create a new personal access token for vim-gista and the created personal access token is saved in your file system (the filled password will never be stored.)

If you prefer to specify a personal access token directory, call `:Gista --login` like below and input your personal access token as a username:

```vim
:Gista --login
```

If you want to temporary logout, call `:Gista --logout` without any arguments.
If you want to logout permanently, call the function with a argument like below:

```vim
:Gista --logout --permanently
```

If will delete a stored personal access token from your file system.


Listing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![vim-gista gista:list buffer screenshot](./doc/screenshot-gistlist.png)

To list your public and private gist entries, run one of the following commands (short form or long form):

```vim
:Gista -l
:Gista --list
```

It will recursively download your gist entries at first time thus you may need to be really patient if you have tons of gists. The entries are cached and the cache will be used for rest of the processions. These cache will be updated automatically when there are any new or modified gists.

Once all your gist entries are downloaded, a buffer named 'gista:list' will be opened. You can manipulate your gists with following keys.

```vim
<F1>        :<C-u>help vim-gista-default-mappings<CR>
<C-l>       <Plug>(gista-action-update)
<C-l><C-l>  <Plug>(gista-action-update-nocache)
<CR>        <Plug>(gista-action-open)
<S-CR>      <Plug>(gista-action-browser)
+           <Plug>(gista-action-star)
-           <Plug>(gista-action-unstar)
?           <Plug>(gista-action-is-starred)
r           <Plug>(gista-action-rename)
D           <Plug>(gista-action-smart-delete)
F           <Plug>(gista-action-fork)
e           <Plug>(gista-action-edit)
s           <Plug>(gista-action-split)
v           <Plug>(gista-action-vsplit)
b           <Plug>(gista-action-browser)
```

If you want to list a particular user's gist entries, give the username to the command like:

```vim
:Gista -l lambdalisue
:Gista --list lambdalisue
```

If you specify 'starred' or 'public' like a username, you will see starred gist entries of your GitHub account or public gist entries in Gist web respectively:
Note: Public gist entries are not downloaded recursively and not cached, due to the amount of the gists.

```vim
:Gista -l starred
:Gista -l public
```

You can specify a particular page with '--page PAGE' option.
When the page is specified, gist entries existing in the page will be downloaded (and never be recursively downloaded and cached.)

```vim
    :Gista -l --page 2
```

If you want to refresh the gist entries (check update and download new or modified gist entries), hit <C-l> (<Plug>(gista-action-update)) on the 'gist:list' buffer.
If you want to re-build a cache of your gist entries, use '--nocache' option then all gist entries are recursively re-downloaded and the cache will be rebuilded by the new downloads.

```vim
    :Gista -l --nocache
```

Or hit <C-l><C-l> (<Plug>(gista-action-update-nocache)) on the 'gist:list' buffer.

Opening
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to open a gist on the 'gist:list' buffer, hit <CR> to open the gist with default opener.
If you want to specify the way to open the buffer, hit e, s, or v for 'edit', 'split', or 'vsplit' respectively.

If you are the owner of the gist, the gist will be opened in modifiable buffer, otherwise it will be opened in nomodifiable buffer.
The buffer will automatically be connected to the gist.
If a buffer is connected to a gist, you can get the gist informations with (the following functions are assumed to be used in statusline):

```vim
:echo gista#statusline#components#gistid()      " return Gist ID
:echo gista#statusline#components#filename()    " return filename
:echo gista#statusline#components#gistinfo()    " return both
```

Or if the buffer is modifiable, you can upload changes on the buffer with posting commands like:

```vim
" Short
:Gista
" Long
:Gista --post
" g:gista#update_on_write = 1
:w
" g:gista#update_on_write = 2
:w!
```

If you provide a new filename with :write command, the buffer will be disconnected from the gist and you will get a new local copy of the gist.

```vim
:w a_new_filename.txt
```

Or if you just want to disconnect, use the following command then the buffer will be liberate from the gist.

```vim
:Gista --disconnect
```

You can open a particular gist via Gist ID as well.
Provide a Gist ID with '--gistid' option and open the gist like:

```vim
    :Gista -o --gistid XXXXXXXXXX
    :Gista --open --gistid XXXXXXXX
```

Then all files in the gist will be opened with default opener.
If you want to open particular files, you can specify filenames with '--filename' option as a semi-colon separated filenames like:

```vim
:Gista -o --gistid XXXXXXXX --filename "A.txt;B.txt;C.txt"
```

Posting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to create a new gist, execute one of the commands below. The commands will create a new gist with a content (or selected content) of a current buffer:

```vim
:Gista
:Gista --post
:'<.'>Gista
:'<.'>Gista --post
```

After you create a new gist, the current buffer will be connected to the gist.

If the current buffer is already connected to a gist or a Gist ID is written in the content (in 'GistID: XXXXXXXX' format) or is specified with '--gistid' option, the command will save changes rather than posting as a new gist.

If you want to specify a description in the command, use '-d' or '--description' option to specify:

```vim
:Gista -d "Description with a short option"
:Gista --description "Description with a long option"
```

If you want to specify a visibility, use '-p' or '--private' to make the gist private, use '-P' or '--public' to make the gist public (the default visibility is determined from the value of g:gista#post_private.
Note: Gist API does not provide a way to modify the visibility of an existing gist thus you cannot change the visibility of a gist in vim-gista interface.

```vim
:Gista -p -d "This is a private gist"
:Gista --private -d "This is a private gist"
:Gista -P -d "This is a public gist"
:Gista --public -d "This is a public gist"
```
If you want to update the gist as an anonymous gist, use '--anonymous' option

```vim
:Gista --anonymous
```

If you want to create a new gist with all opened buffer. Specify '--multiple' to the command like

```vim
:Gista --multiple
```

Again, if the gist ID is specified to the command, the command will post all
opened buffer to the specified gist (it will replace the content if a same
filename file exists on the gist).

vim-gista have much more features, check it out with

```vim
:help vim-gista-usage
```

With Unite.vim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![vim-gista with Unite.vim (screenshot)](./doc/screenshot-unite.png)
![vim-gista with Unite.vim (screencast)](./doc/screencast-unite.gif)

(The screencast was taken in development stage. The interface is changed a bit in the production.)

If you are using [Unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim), you can manipulate gists with it.
The source name is 'gista' thus call the unite as follow:

```vim
:Unite gista
```

There are much more implementations, see with

```vim
:help vim-gista-unite-interface
```
